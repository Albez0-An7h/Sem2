# Lecture 13: JavaScript Asynchronous Programming

## 1. Introduction to Asynchronous Programming (15 minutes)

- Objective: Understand why we need asynchronous programming and its fundamental concepts.

- Key Points:
  1. JavaScript's single-threaded nature (5 minutes)
  2. Blocking vs Non-blocking operations (5 minutes)
  3. Common use cases for async operations (5 minutes)
  <!-- 4. Event Loop and Call Stack //- lets not talk about this right now -->
- Engagement:
    - Demonstrate blocking behavior with synchronous code
    - Show real-world examples of async operations

## 2. Evolution of Async Patterns (13 minutes)

- Objective: Understand the history and evolution of handling async operations in JavaScript.

- Key Steps:
    1. Promises: (3 minutes)
        - Revision of Promise syntax (1 minute)
        - Revision of Promise states and chain operations (2 minutes)
    2. Modern async/await: (5 minutes)
        - Cleaner syntax for handling Promises (3 minutes)
        - Benefits over previous approaches (2 minutes)

- Practical Activity: (5 minutes)
    - Convert Promise chains to async/await 

## 3. Understanding async/await Keywords (22 minutes)

- Objective: Master the usage of async and await keywords.

- Key Concepts:
    - The `async` keyword: (4 minutes)
        - What it does to a function?
        - Return values always wrapped in Promises
    - The `await` keyword: (3+2 minutes)
        - Where it can be used?
        - How it unwraps Promises?
    - Basic Syntax: (3 minutes)

        ```javascript
        async function example() {
          const result = await someAsyncOperation();
          return result;
        }
        ```

- Live Demo: (3 minutes)
    - Create async functions with different return values
    - Show await behavior with Promises

- Student Practice: (7 minutes)
    - Write basic async functions (2 minutes)
    - Use await with provided Promise-based APIs (5 minutes)

## 4. Error Handling in Async Code (12 minutes)

- Objective: Learn proper error handling techniques in async/await code.
- Key Points: (7 minutes)
    - try/catch blocks: (5 minutes)
        - Proper syntax and usage (3 minutes)
        - Scope of error catching (2 minutes)
    - Best practices: (2 minutes)

        ```javascript
        async function safeOperation() {
          try {
            const result = await riskyOperation();
            return result;
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error:', error);
            throw new Error('Operation failed');
          }
        }
        ```

- Live Demo: (5 minutes)
    - Different error handling scenarios
    - Common pitfalls and solutions

<!-- - Practice Activity: (7 minutes)
    - Implement error handling in async functions
    - Debug broken async code -->

## 6. Recap and Q&A (5 minutes)

- Recap: Key topics covered:
  1. Async programming fundamentals
  2. async/await syntax and usage
  3. Error handling patterns

- Takeaway Task:
    - Build a small application using async/await
    - Practice error handling and parallel operations

## 7. Quiz (10 minutes)

Example quiz questions:

- What is the purpose of the async keyword?
- How does await affect Promise resolution?
- When should you use try/catch with async functions?
- What's the difference between Promise.all and Promise.race?
- How do you handle multiple async operations in parallel?
- What happens when an error occurs in an async function?
- How do you convert a Promise chain to async/await?
- What are the benefits of async/await over Promises?
- How does the Event Loop relate to async operations?
- When should you use sequential vs parallel async operations?
