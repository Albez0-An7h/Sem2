# Introduction to JavaScript (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Understand what JavaScript is, how it works with HTML and CSS, and how it helps make web pages interactive.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. Without JavaScript, web pages would be static and only show text and images. JavaScript helps to add things like:
- Buttons that do something when clicked
- Forms that check if you’ve filled them out correctly
- Changing things on the page without reloading it (like updating scores in a game)

In short, JavaScript is what makes websites come alive!

## How JavaScript Works with HTML and CSS

When you create a web page, you use **HTML** for the structure (the content), **CSS** for the style (how it looks), and **JavaScript** for the functionality (what happens when users interact with it).

### HTML:
- This is the structure of the page (what you see: headings, buttons, text, images, etc.).

### CSS:
- This controls the look and feel of the page (colors, sizes, fonts, etc.).

### JavaScript:
- This makes the page interactive (what happens when you click a button, or change something on the page).

## Key Points to Remember:
1. **HTML** gives the page structure (like headings, buttons, and paragraphs).
2. **CSS** controls the look of the page (like colors, sizes, and fonts).
3. **JavaScript** adds the magic — it makes the page interactive by changing things or responding to actions like clicks.

JavaScript helps bring your web page to life by allowing you to interact with it!
