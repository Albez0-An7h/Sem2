# Printing in JavaScript (5 minutes)

**Objective**: Learn how to display output in JavaScript using `console.log()`.

## Printing in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the simplest way to print (or display) information is using `console.log()`. This function shows messages in the **browserâ€™s Developer Tools Console** (a part of the browser where developers can see and interact with their code).

### Why Use `console.log()`?
- **Debugging**: It helps you see what's happening in your code.
- **Testing**: It lets you check if your code is doing what you expect.

## Basic Syntax

To print something, just write:

```javascript
console.log("Your message here");
