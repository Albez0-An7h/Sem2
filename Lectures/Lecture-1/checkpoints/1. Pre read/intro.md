# Pre-read Check (5 minutes)

**Objective**: Ensure students have understood the key concepts in the pre-read material and address any questions they may have.

## Questions to Ask:

1. **How does JavaScript's variable declaration differ from Python's?**
   - Can you explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript and how it compares to Python's variable assignment?

2. **What are the use cases where you would choose JavaScript over Python?**
   - Think about the strengths of each language. When would you prefer using JavaScript instead of Python, especially in web development?

3. **What are template literals in JavaScript and how do they compare to Python's f-strings?**
   - Can you explain how template literals work in JavaScript and provide an example similar to Pythonâ€™s f-string formatting?

## Follow-up:
- After each question, allow students to share their answers.
- Provide clarifications where necessary and encourage students to ask questions if they are unsure.
