# Lecture 1: Introduction to JavaScript

**Overview:**
In this lecture, we introduced the basics of **JavaScript** for beginners, drawing comparisons with Python to help you get comfortable with JavaScript’s syntax and features.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- **Introduction to JavaScript**: Understanding its importance for web development.
- **Printing Output**: How to use `console.log()` to display information.
- **Declaring Variables**: Learning to declare and assign variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.

By the end of this lecture, you’ll be able to print messages to the console and work with simple variables in JavaScript.

# Lecture 2: Data Types and Operators in JavaScript

## Overview:
In this lecture, we explored JavaScript’s data types and operators, essential building blocks for any JavaScript program. We built on concepts from the first lecture and introduced both primitive and non-primitive data types, along with various operators to manipulate and evaluate data.

## Key Topics Covered:

1. **Data Types**:
   - Primitive: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `Symbol`, and `BigInt`.
   - Non-Primitive: `Object` and `Array`.
   - Using `typeof` to determine variable types.

2. **Operators**:
   - **Arithmetic**: Performing calculations with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and `**`.
   - **Assignment**: Assigning and updating values with `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
   - **Comparison**: Comparing values with `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.
   - **Logical**: Combining conditions with `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
   - **Bitwise**: Manipulating binary representations with `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, and `>>>`.

## Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this lecture, you’ll be able to:
- Identify and use different data types in JavaScript.
- Apply various operators to manipulate and evaluate data.
- Write simple programs that combine these concepts to solve problems.

Practice these skills and experiment with examples to deepen your understanding!
